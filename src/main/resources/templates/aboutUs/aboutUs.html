				Established in New York City over fifteen years ago, SneakersClub revolutionized sneaker retail as the original consignment store for rare shoes. 
				Carrying the latest drops, coveted classics and hard-to-find grails, SneakersClub has evolved from a one-stop sneaker destination to a cultural hub for sneaker 
				enthusiasts and novices alike. With three brick-and-mortar locations in London, Los Angeles and Buenos Aires, SneakersClub remains the premier source for authentic, rare shoes.
				SneakersClub is owned and operated by GOAT Group. To learn more about SneakersClub's parent company, please visit the official GOAT Group website.

				At our store, we are unwavering in our commitment to providing our customers with sneakers of the highest quality. We
				understand that when you invest in a pair of sneakers, you expect them to not only look great but also offer superior
				comfort, durability, and performance. That's why we go to great lengths to ensure that every sneaker in our inventory
				meets and exceeds the highest standards of quality. The quality of our sneakers starts with the materials used in their
				construction. We prioritize sourcing premium materials that are not only durable but also provide optimal comfort and
				support. From high-quality leathers and suede to breathable mesh fabrics and cutting-edge synthetic materials, we select
				materials that are built to last and offer superior performance. We understand that the choice of materials greatly
			    impacts the overall quality and feel of the sneakers, and we are committed to delivering nothing but the best.
				To ensure that every pair of sneakers meets our stringent quality criteria, we have implemented a rigorous quality
				control process. Each pair undergoes thorough inspections at various stages of production, from the initial cutting and
				stitching to the final assembly and finishing touches. Our dedicated quality control team meticulously checks every
				detail, ensuring that the sneakers meet our strict standards for stitching integrity, construction, adhesive strength,
				and overall finish.
